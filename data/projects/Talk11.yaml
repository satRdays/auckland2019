description: "Teaching the fundamentals of statistical theory can often be a thankless task. Defining a probability density function or interpreting a hypothesis test? It's easy to get lost in the formulae. Linking statistical concepts and conveying these links to students can often be challenging. From using a cheeky cat to rejuvenate the linchpin coin toss example to an R shiny app that allows students to explore probability distributions I will discuss making animated plots in R to illustrate some of the fundamentals of statistical theory."

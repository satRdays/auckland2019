description: "Open-source software is fundamentally necessary to ensure that the tools of
data science are broadly accessible, and to provide a reliable and
trustworthy foundation for reproducible research. This talk will delve into
why open source software is so important and discuss the role of
corporations as stewards of open source software. I'll also talk about how
RStudio is structured and organized to pursue its mission of creating open
source software for data science."

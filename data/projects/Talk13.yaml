description: "NZight is an R driven GUI that providing a simple way for visually exploring data and much more. It comes in two “flavours”, a GTK-driven desktop version and a Shiny-driven online version. Our aim is to empower a much wider cross-section of the populace with significant data-science capabilities, making these much more accessible to beginners and occasional users with gentler learning curves and much less reliance on knowing/remembering the names of the things you want to do. We are also working toward closing the GUI-coding loop with system-written R code and markdown files. For example, iNZight already writes code for most of the data-wrangling operations in “R for Data Science”, lots of ggplot2 graphics, and generalised linear modelling. Tom Elliot, the main system architect, is giving a related talk focussing on programming issues."

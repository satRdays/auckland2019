description: "Dragonfly Data Science is a team of 8 scientists who do statistical work across ecology, linguistics, industry and the public sector. We are stubborn proponents of reproducible work, and achieve this using a mix of make, docker and our own continuous integration system, Gorbachev. I will be talking about how we combine these tools to create a flexible, reproducible work environment that we have been able to use to solve a vast range of analytical challenges."

bio: "Anna Fergusson is obsessed with teaching, in particular with developing inclusive, engaging, accessible, effective and fun ways to introduce people to learning statistics and data science. Before joining the University of Auckland as a Professional Teaching Fellow (Statistics), she was Head of Mathematics and Statistics at Avondale College for five years and a classroom teacher for 12 years. Anna is on the steering group the New Zealand Statistical Association education committee and is involved with the international collaboration between the New Zealand Statistical Association and the American Statistical Association. Her research has focused on exploring task and tool design for teaching statistical modelling. As part of her PhD research project, Anna is currently working closely with high school teachers to develop tools, tasks, assessment and learning programmes to support data science education at high school level."
description: "Teaching introductory-level statistics within the modern world of data requires consideration of how to balance the learning of new statistical, computational, data-related and tool-related knowledge. This talk will explore the design of learning tasks that make use of both GUI-driven and code-driven tools, with a focus on introducing learners unfamiliar with R to statistical modelling. Iâ€™ll also discuss and give examples of how existing R packages, web-based tools and apps can be extended and re-imagined to support learners to integrate statistical and computational thinking."

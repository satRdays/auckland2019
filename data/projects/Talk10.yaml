bio: "Since 2014, Tom has been responsible for most of the development of iNZight, while also working towards a PhD in statistics."
description: "iNZight is an R driven GUI, developed by students at UoA, providing a simple way for statistics learners to visually explore a dataset (and more). In this talk, I'll give a brief history of the student-led development of iNZight* (and my part in it) before describing a few of the core programming concepts we've used (or been stuck with) over the years, including OOP, reactivity, extensibility, and separability; with R examples, of course!<br>

* The GTK-driven desktop version, not the Shiny-driven online version."

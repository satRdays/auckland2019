bio: "Simon Urbanek is a Senior Lecturer of Data Science at the University of Auckland. He has been working at AT&T Labs in Data Science and AI Research for 15 years and is a member of the R Core Development Team with interests in visualization, interactive graphics, distributed computing and Big Data analytics. He is the author of RCloud and numerous R packages including Rserve, rJava, multicore, iotools, iPlots, RJDBC, Cairo and many others. Simon received his Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of Augsburg in 2004."
description: "Data science encompasses the full analytic workflow starting with obtaining data, cleaning it, iteration over problem formulation, visualization, data modeling all the way to application and presentation. In real-world applications such process involves several collaborators, diverse tools and the scale of data can be in the hundreds of billions of data records. In this talk we will illustrate how R can be used by many users in a collaborative open-source RCloud environment to collaborate, share data analyses, visualizations and results openly. The design also allows scaling across many instances, the use of could computing and deployment of dashboards and results on production systems. At the same time this environment can be combined with distributed computing to scale not only with the number of users but also with the size of datasets. It has proven to be a fundamental infrastructure for data analytics on large data lakes in the industry. All tools presented in this talk have been released as open source."
